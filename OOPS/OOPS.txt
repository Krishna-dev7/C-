1. Static member😁👋🏻
Static data member:
👉🏻  It is a special data member of class , which is declared with special 'static' keyword.
👉🏻  This member has only single copy which shared with all of their class objects. 
👉🏻  It is always initialize with zero and no other value is permitted to initialize.⚠️
👉🏻  And this member automatically initialize with zero when first class object has been created.⚠️
👉🏻  It is independent of all objects.
👉🏻  After each class we need to re-declare it by using scope resolution operator(::) , because it cannot 
    initialize within the class.


Static member function:
    Static member function is also an special member function which is declared with 'static' keyword.
    This member function can only access to the static data members , and no other member is accessible.
    Static members are independent of objects so to access it , we need to use class_name with scope resolution operator.
    Syntax: to call function.
        class_name::Function();

2. scope resolution operator(::):
    Use to define function outside of class.
    Use to access static member of class.
    So, we can conclude that this operator is used to access something outside of their scope.
