Dynamic memory allocation is process of allocating memory dynamically at the run time.

Points to keep remember while using dynamic memory allocation.
Whenever we create array of any data type we need to specify their size, in case we need to allocate memory dynamically then 
so we will definetly use such allocations.

On static allocation compiler will allocate stack memory, but in dynamic allocation it will allocate heap memory

It can be achieved by using "new" keyword, but it will return us the address of the first index of array.
so we will use pointer of the same class or data type.

Syntax:
    Data_type *pointer_name = new Data_type[size];

    For example:
        Class1 *c = new Class1[n];


And the allocated memory can easily freed up by using "delete" keyword.

Syntax: 
    delete pointer;
    or 
    delete pointer[];
