⚠️Char array have some limitaions:

1. static size or size must be allocated first.
2. null character or terminator '\0'.
3. It completely behave different with cin operator.

🅱️Methods to reverse a string.

➡️  while(s<e){
        swap(name[s++], name[e--]);
    }


⚠️In case of arrays.
    Function always take their address but behave different with int array and char array;
    But in other case it simply copy their values.
    

⚠️In case of objects while behave as variables of class type:
    So in that case we cannot get their address with their name only
    and we need to use reference operator.
